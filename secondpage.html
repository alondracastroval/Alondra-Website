  <h2 style = 'color: blueviolet; font-size: 30px' > My Favorite Games</h2>

  <img src ="https://i.redd.it/neyl0yyuq8v71.jpg"
    alt = "" width = 400>

  <ul>
    <li>Rise of the Tomb Raider</li>
    <li>Ghost of Tsushima</li>
    <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
    <li>Assasin's Creed: Syndicate</li>
    </ul> 

    <p>
        I deeply enjoy video games that have a strong focus in the storyline of the game.<br>
         Death stranding 2, Ghost of Tsushima, and Red Redemption 2 have amazing stories <br>
         that allow the game to excel beyond the gameplay aspects of the game. Additionally, <br>
         they all have beautiful open worlds that shine with the complexity of the graphics.<br>
          With amazing technical aspect, great gameplay mechanics, and memorable storylines <br>
          these games stand out to me as a very picky gamer.

<div class = "musiclist">
    <!-- music section -------------------->
 <h2 style = 'color: blueviolet; font-size: 30px' > My Favorite Music</h2>
 <img src ="https://images.genius.com/885ec544238ef6c1b7387eb639196819.1000x1000x1.png"
    alt = "" width = 290
    >
<ul>
    <li>PARTYNEXTDOOR</li>
    <li>Steve Lacy</li>
    <li>Tyler, the Creator</li>
    <li>Summer Walker</li>
</ul>

<p>

My favorite music genres are: RNB, indie music, and corridos. Although, I do find myself <br>
listening to other genres often and I am always open to branch out to new artists. I love <br> 
making playlists to fit a certain mood that I am currently feeling or just organizing music <br>
that I like to listen to when doing a certain task. For instance, I have a cleaning playlist, <br>
a homework playlist, and a running playlist. I believe its super fun to play around with <br>
playlists and I enjoy it alot as a form of self expression!

<!-- Academics Section-->
<div class = "projects">
 <h2 style = 'color: blueviolet; font-size: 30px' > My Favorite Classes</h2>
  <img src ="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/campus_update_09.jpg"
    alt = "" width = 390>
 <ul>
    <li>Foundations of Data Science</li>
    <li>Mathematics of Data Models</li>
    <li>Quantitaive Models of Consumer Analysis</li>
    <li>Introduction to Marketing</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
    The favorite part about my academic experience is that Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to mix<br> 
    my interests of Data and Marketing. My favorite courses have allowed me to learn all about<br> 
    data and how we can use it in real life business scenarios. In my Foundations of Data Science<br> 
    class I got to make a football prediction model with machine learning which was super cool and <br> 
    one of my favorite academic projects!
