        Hi there! My name is Alondra Castro-Valadez and I am currently <br>
        a 4th year Computer Science and Marketing Analytics major at Northeastern.
        <br> I am originally from Houston, Texas and correspondingly, a huge Houston <br>
        sports fan. My favorite teams are the Texans, and the Rockets, but I also love  <br>
        the red sox. Academically, my interests and passion rely on the intersection between <br>
        computer science and business. I have also come to become very interested in <br>
        data science and how it applies to business scenarios. Additionally, I enjoy using  <br>
        my acquired knowledge and relate it to my interests. For instance, I love using data <br>
        to make predictions on sports data. 
        <br> <br>
	    Outside of school, I really enjoy playing video games. <br>
        My favorite video games of all time are Red Dead Redemption, Rise of the Tomb Raider, <br>
        and Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Currently, I am playing Ghost of Yotei and Death Stranding 2. <br>
        I recently switched to a ps5 after being an xbox gamer, so I am enjoying playing all of the playstation<br>
         exclusives. Additionally, I really enjoy listening to music! I love putting together Spotify playlists <br>
        that correspond to different moods, genres, and seasons. Most of the time I am listening to <br>
        music and have my headphones on at all times.

    </p>
